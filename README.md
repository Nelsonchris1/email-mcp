## üì¶ Install Dependencies

The project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management. Install all dependencies using UV:

```bash
uv pip install .
```

## ‚úÖ How It Works

1. User asks a question in Claude Desktop.
2. Claude identifies that the query may require email data.
3. The MCP client triggers the `email_reader.py` script via UV.
4. The script connects to Gmail using IMAP and retrieves relevant data.
5. The result is returned to the MCP client.
6. Claude responds to the user with a data-enriched answer.
